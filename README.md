# H R Portal

This is a sample HR portal designed using React JS. 

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate basic concepts of React JS and build a simple responsive website. 

## Overview

Currently the webpage consists of four modules:
* Profile
* Clearance
* Discount
* Links

For each of these modules, there is a corresponding backend api and an agreed upon data model. For this implementation, mock data has been used.

## Running it locally

To run this project locally, you may want to install NodeJS. Once you have it, clone the project, inside the project library run the command __npm start__

The website must be then accessible in http://localhost:3000/sample-react-app
